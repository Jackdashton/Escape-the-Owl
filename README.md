# Escape-the-Owl

## Project Description
This project is a web-based vocabulary quiz game developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The app allows users to play a vocabulary quiz game by answering from a series of multiple-choice questions. The app also includes a visual representation of the userâ€™s progress in order to gamify the quiz; moving either the user or the owl depending on whether the answer is correct, with the aim to escape the owl. The app was a good opportunity to practice DOM manipulation and the fundamentals of JavaScript as well as work on frontend design using CSS and HTML.
